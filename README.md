# LuxOpenTransportData

MATLAB code to query the Luxembourg Mobilite Transport Open Data API
Python code generated by chatGPT (translation of teh MATLAB code) and likely not kept up to fdate with latest MATLAB code
Some infomration about the API schema here
https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/api-mobiliteit-lu/ 

Note: no explanations on the website about the data that is returned.

Here are some example fields that are self explantory

STOP LOCATION QUERY RETURNS:
   Stops = webread(request);   is the API call

this returns a number of stops - all within the stated search radius
data on one such stop is found inside 
   Stops.stopLocationOrCoordLocation(1).StopLocation
This has fields such as 
   StopLocation.name  = 'Esch-sur-Alzette, Porte des Sciences'
   StopLocation.extID = '220402129' this is the identification number needed to query the departure board
   StopLocation.products = 32  Not sure what this is - it does not match the number of lines/services at this stop given in StopLocation.productAtStop
   StopLocation.productAtStop = struct array with e.g. 8 entries
   StopLocation.productAtStop(1).name = 'Bus 4'
   StopLocation.productAtStop(1).line = '4'

DEPARTURE BOARD QUERY RETURNS:
   thisStopDeps = webread(timeReq);
Contains multiple departures, the j-th has fields such as    
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.name = 'Bus 551'
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.stop = 'Esch-sur-Alzette, Porte des Sciences'
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.time = '09:23:00'      timetabled time???
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.rtTime = '09:32:00'    current predicted time??
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.prognosisType = 'PROGNOSED'   ?????
   thisStopDeps.Departure{j}.JourneyStatus = 'P'    = prognosed?
